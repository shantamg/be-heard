/**
 * Applying stream metadata to the query cache.

 * When the model's tool call arrives mid-stream, some of it must reach the UI
 * immediately (so panels open while text is still streaming) and some of it
 * must be refetched from the server (because the authoritative record is
 * written server-side).
 *
 * The split matters: broad invalidation during an active stream races the
 * optimistic writes and makes indicators flicker, so the direct-write path is
 * kept deliberately narrow and the invalidation path is kept explicit.
 *
 * The nested cache transforms are exported separately because they are pure and
 * the nesting is where mistakes hide — writing to the wrong depth silently
 * no-ops rather than throwing.
