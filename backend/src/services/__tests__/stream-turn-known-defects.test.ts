/**
 * CHARACTERIZATION of a KNOWN PRE-EXISTING DEFECT in the streaming turn:
 * malformed boolean tool input becoming a definite `false`.
 *
 * DO NOT "fix" these tests. The defect exists ACROSS a seam — the tool parser
 * is right to refuse the value, and resolution is right to backfill an absent
 * one; the loss happens between them — so it is pinned by composing the real
 * model and resolution services in the order the controller runs them.
 *
 * When the defect is genuinely fixed, these tests should fail. That failure is
 * the signal to delete them, not to loosen them.
 *
 * The other known defect (a mid-stream disconnect truncating the persisted AI
 * message) is a property of the controller's orchestration and is pinned
 * against the real `sendMessageStream` — see the note above the second test.
